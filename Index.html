    <h2>The problem is not that we lack the necessary resources and skills to address the challenges we face. The hitch is that we have tremendous difficulty putting what we have into the combinations we need.</h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>So here are somethings to keep in mind:-</h2>
  <br>
  <p>1. Research shows that wearing masks can reduce transmission of COVID19 by 85%. Individuals should wear masks when in crowded places and indoors to reduce the spread of the virus.</p>
  <br>
  <p>2.Increased testing can help identify more infected individuals. We could isolate and quarantine such individuals to help break the chain and reduce transmission. We can increase testing through the following measures:</p>
  <br>
  <p> a) Increasing sample collection centers and making testing services more accessible will help more individuals get tested.</p>
      <br>

  <br>
  <p> b) States should deploy new and novel technologies such as the Tata Feluda test to make testing cheaper, faster, and more accessible.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>3. The current surge of the COVID19 epidemic is blamed on the new B.1.617 variant. With genomic sequencing, we can identify new variants of the virus and prevent its spread through targeted interventions.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>4. Remove technology literacy hurdles: The current roll-out favors the technology-literate since any individual needs to use the online platform to get a shot. This has left behind a large section of the population who are not technology literates, such as construction laborers, taxi drivers, and rural elderly.</p>

  <br>
  <br>
  <p>4. Oxygen Transportation Network: Careful monitoring of oxygen transportation can ensure hospitals do not run out of essential oxygen.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>5. Invest in Research & Development: Investment in research can bring out innovative methods and inform public policy to better control the virus.</p>
